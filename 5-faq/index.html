                    <p>It's distinct. Astronauts describe a lingering scent of <strong>seared steak, hot metal, and welding fumes</strong>. It is believed to be the smell of dying stars (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons).</p>

                    <p>A real scientific term. If you fall feet-first into a black hole, the gravity at your feet is so much stronger than at your head that you would be stretched into a long, thin strand of atoms.</p>

                    <p>Technically, space is a vacuum, so sound waves can't travel. However, NASA has converted electromagnetic plasma waves (like those around Saturn) into audible sound. It sounds like haunting, whistling wind.</p>

                    <p>There is a massive region in the universe that is significantly colder than its surroundings. Some theorists speculate it could be the "bruise" from a collision with a parallel universe.</p>

                    <p>On Neptune and Uranus, yes. The intense atmospheric pressure crushes carbon atoms into diamond crystals, which then rain down toward the planet's frozen core.</p>

                    <p>Something massive, hundreds of millions of light-years away, is pulling our entire galaxy (and thousands of others) towards it at 1.3 million miles per hour. We can't see what it is because the Milky Way blocks our view.</p>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Yes. If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in the vacuum of space, they will permanently bond together. This is called "Cold Welding."</p>
